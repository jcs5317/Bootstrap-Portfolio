            <p>I have been fortunate to live, learn, and work most of my life in beautiful Arizona. Beginning in 1990 when my family and I first step foot in the state, there have been many instances that were meaningful and have helped me become who I am today.</p>

            <p>A top meaningful moment  would have to include completing my Undergraduate studies with a Bachelors of Science degree in Business Management and Marketing from Arizona State University in 2007. The achievement was the result of several years of studying how companies operate, produce quality products and promote their brands to the dynamically changing and broad range of consumers.</p> 

            <p>My work experience and career development has also been tremendously valuable to me, including my involvement in the technology industry and most recently the role I had with a software company. As an Account Manager I was able to not only working to build lasting  relationships with clients but also saw how much they relied on software to improve productivity, automate processes, manage costs and increase profits. Seeing the impact that software was having on the success of business guided and inspired me to pursue additional education through the University of Arizona to gain a better knowledge of how to develop software, specifically web applications, along with the skills necessary to be a Full-Stack Developer.</p>

            <p>Every letter of the alphabet has a positive acronym that describes myself and the connections I have with this amazing place and people here. Amiable truly is a quality adjective I find necessary to begin with, it is so important to me that I constantly remind myself that being friendly should be like a reflex and the more amicable I become will help those people around me be so too. Astonishingly there are a few words that begin with “z,” like “zippy” that I embrace as well. If I am demonstrating at least a hint of zippiness each day I feel there is a good chance at a zestful life.</p>
