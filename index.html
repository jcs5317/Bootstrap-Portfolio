            <p>I have been fortunate to live, learn, and work most of my life in beautiful Arizona. Beginning in 1990 when my family and I first step foot in the state, there have been many meaningful moments that have helped me become who I am today.</p>

            <p>A top meaningful moment would have to include completing my Undergraduate studies with a Bachelors of Science degree in Business Management and Marketing from Arizona State University in 2007. The achievement was the result of several years of studying an array of subjects along with the essential components of companies; their operations, goods and services and how they promote their brands to the dynamically changing and broad range of shifting consumers.</p> 

            <p>My work experience and career development has been tremendously valuable to me. I am proud of what I have achieved while soaring in many different industries (water treatment, sports and entertainment retail, hospitality) however being in the technology industry, and most recently my role as an Account Manager with a software company, has put me on a path to new heights. I am constantly motivated to show my abilities to not only work toward building lasting relationships with clients but also discover how much business truly can benefit from reliable software that improves productivity, automate processes, manage costs and increase profits. Seeing the impact that software is having on every aspect of business guided and inspired me to pursue additional education through the University of Arizona in 2019 to gain more knowledge of how to develop software, specifically web applications, along with gaining the necessary skills to be a Full-Stack Developer.</p>

            <p>This page does not cover everything about me A to Z but I will say that every letter of the alphabet has a positive word that describes myself and who I have set out to become. Amiable truly is a quality adjective I find necessary to begin with, it is so important to me that I make constant reminders to myself that; being friendly should be a reflex and by becoming amicable I will be better prepared to help people around me be so too. Astonishingly there are a few words that begin with “z,” like “zippy” that I find fitting as well. If I am demonstrating at least a hint of zippiness each day I feel there is a good chance at a zestful life.</p>
